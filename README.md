# SpringSecurityDemo
Demo project on JWT security for web application

This project takes us through the demonstration of how jwt token is applied to secure every resource in the application and defines the overall flow of the jwt process - userdetailservice, securityfilterchain, autjenticationprovider, authenticationmanager, generate token and token validation before providing resource access.

- For DB, Postgresql is used and can be changed to anyother DB just by changing the config file.
